## Data Used
### Data you provide to the app
-	Image containing people’s faces:
    - From camera
    - From photo gallery

### Data calculated by app
-	Estimated age.
-	Estimated gender.
- Estimated emotions.
-	Estimated probabilities of having facial hair.
-	Estimated head position in degrees.

## Purpose of Data 
**The app does not collect or store data on users.** Data is only calculated one time for each picture the user takes and this information is not stored. Once the app is closed, the app does not have access to the image or analysis of the faces in an image.

This data is required to provide the primary service of analyzing the faces within an image and displaying the resulting information.Without being given an image from the user, the app wouldn’t be able to function as intended. 
Therefore, the app receives the image either through the camera or a picture that the user chooses from the photo gallery.

## Who Can See Your Data
**Only the user of the app.**

The only person who can view the image and the facial information is the user of the app because that info never leaves the app. Additionally, the app does not even store the data on the device or in a database so it only exists while the app is open, thus making the user the only person who can see the data/info.

## Permissions the App Requests
Upon installation, the app asks for camera permission and permission to access photos and media stored in the device's storage. Only one of these is necessary to use the app, but using both is recommended.

However, the app will not be able to serve its purpose if neither one of the permissions are granted.

## Disclaimer
**Please keep in mind that the app is not 100% accurate.** Therefore, it may not be able to accurately determine your age or gender every time it is used.

For more information on how the app determines your facial attributes, you can check out the [Microsoft Face API.](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/face/) which is the tool that the app uses to determine the facial attributes.

## Your Privacy Rights
You have the ability to revoke the app’s camera permission from your device’s Settings. Once this done, the app will not have access to the camera or photo gallery. 

However, it is important to note that doing so will prevent it from serving its purpose of providing facial information from images.
